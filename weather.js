//check for location settings, get lat & lon if available
//if not, prompt for box input for city and dropdown for state? 

//api request by lat&lon for weather info
//parse json info for temp, maybe more? prob more
//display in cute way? not sure how yet

//maybe add way to save list of locations? to easily access again
//with list of locations. should be able to add to list or remove any from list. array?

//account creation? or what? could array of saved locations. Array of lat,lon pairs? But, save as cookie maybe?
//making accounts requires database and hashing?

//refresh automatically? or by button maybe to just get new call to api for new data
